==================
django-speak
==================

A fun (and bizarre) set of Django filters to convert a string into a 
different type of speech.

Available filters:

* ``pirate`` -- Returns text in "Pirate speak", like you hear in pirate movies.
* ``rasta`` -- Returns text in a Jamaican "Rastafari" speak, like in Reggae music.
* ``shakespeare`` -- Returns text in a Shakespearean format.

Installation
============

1. To use the django-speak, you first need to add ``speak`` to
``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your settings file::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'speak',
    )

2. Next, in your template, load the library and apply the filter to a variable 
you want to change::

    {% load speak %}
    {{ myvar|pirate }}
    
Example
=======

If you were to use the ``pirate`` filter in your templates, and you pass it this
string for example::

    You are a beautiful woman, do you want to have a drink with me?

... you would get this in return::

    Yar is a fancy lass, do yar wants to come carouse with me?

More...

I'm going to continually add new words to each language, and hopefully some more 
languages as well.

If you find any bugs, have some feedback or have a new language requests, go here
http://github.com/danawoodman/django-speak/issues and create a case.

If you use these in your project, send me an email at dana (at) danawoodman.com
so I can see what you did!

Enjoy!
